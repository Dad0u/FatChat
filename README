This project is the extension of "Chat-PA-10", a client/server chat program written in Python using Tkinter.
I wanted to rewrite it in a cleaner way, including encryption, fully funcitonnal GUI, and more
It is functionnal as it is but still needs major improvments, especially regarding stability, security and interface...

The newer version will probably use asymetric encryption method (RSA?) at handshake, then regular encryption with a shared key. 
Also, it will support server with password, open or with passfile (and maybe an optional client verification security to create private servers).
